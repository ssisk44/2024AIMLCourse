## Python for Data Science - Session 8 Notes
* Correlation
  * Positive
  * Negative
  > Pearson Correlation (x & y): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient
  > https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/correlation-coefficient/

* Causation
  * Direction
  * Strength - absolute value

* Hypothesis Testing
  1) Null Hypothesis (Ho) - Avg Height of German = Avg Height of Dutch
  2) Alternate Hypothesis (Ha) - Avg Height of German != Avg Height of Dutch
  * Test -> Statistics => p-value
  * P-value is evidence against the Ho
  * Significance Level (α alpha) => provides confidence level (95% = 0.05)
    * p < α(0.05) => Reject Ho
    * p > 0.05 => Accept Ho
  * Sample Statistics => Population Statistics

* Normal Distribution  

* t-test - compare the mean of two groups  
> 1) independent sample t-test => compare sample mean with expected population mean
> 

* chi-squared test (categorical data)  


* ANOVA - analysis of variance  
> comparing the mean of more than two groups

* sample size < 30 THEN t-test
* sample size > 30 THEN z-test
